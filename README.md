**KJason** is a simple **JSON** parser written in the [Kotlin](https://kotlinglang.org) language.

This project was purely made to get familiarity with Kotlin by working on real everyday problems.
It is not advised to anybody to use this code in production environments without refactoring.

The grammar followed and respected by the [parser](src/main/kotlin/it/fulminazzo/kjason/KJason.kt)
is the [official JSON grammar in McKeeman form](https://www.crockford.com/mckeeman.html).
